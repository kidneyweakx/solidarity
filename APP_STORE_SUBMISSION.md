## üîê Cryptography and Export Compliance

### Encryption Declaration

**Does your app use encryption?** ‚úÖ YES

**Purpose of Encryption:**
1. **Local Data Protection** (AES-GCM)
   - Encrypts business cards stored on device
   - Encrypts group membership data
   - Protects user privacy

2. **Peer-to-Peer Communication** (Apple MultipeerConnectivity)
   - Uses Apple's built-in TLS encryption
   - Secure device-to-device sharing

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (Semaphore Protocol)
   - Privacy-preserving identity verification
   - Cryptographic group membership proofs
   - NO financial transactions

**Export Compliance:**
- [x] Encryption is for **user authentication and privacy protection only**
- [x] NOT used for financial transactions
- [x] NOT a cryptocurrency wallet
- [x] Uses standard iOS frameworks (PassKit, Keychain)
- [x] Exempt from export compliance (Category 5 Part 2)

**ECCN Classification:** `5D992.c` or exempt under category 5 Part 2
(Encryption for authentication and privacy, not for financial transactions)

## üõ°Ô∏è Zero-Knowledge Proof Technology Explanation

### For App Review Team

**What is Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)?**

Zero-Knowledge Proofs are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove a statement is true WITHOUT revealing any additional information.

**Example in Solid(ar)ity:**
- User wants to prove: "I am a member of Company X employees"
- Without revealing: Which specific employee they are
- The proof confirms membership without exposing identity

**Why This is NOT Cryptocurrency:**
- No blockchain transactions
- No financial transfers
- No tokens or coins
- No wallet functionality (besides Apple Wallet for contact cards)
- Used solely for **privacy-preserving identity verification**

**Technical Details:**
- **Protocol:** Semaphore (audited, open-source ZK protocol)
- **Framework:** Mopro (mobile ZK proof generation)
- **Computation:** All on-device, no network calls
- **Storage:** Private keys in iOS Keychain (hardware-backed)

**Privacy Benefits:**
1. Verify group membership without doxxing users
2. Selective disclosure: share minimal information
3. Unlinkability: different proofs can't be correlated

**Use Cases in App:**
- Professional group verification (e.g., "Conference attendees")
- Alumni networks
- Company employee verification
- Privacy-preserving credential sharing

**NOT Used For:**
- Financial transactions
- Cryptocurrency payments
- Blockchain interactions
- Money transfers

## üß™ Testing Instructions for App Review

### Test Account
**No account required!** The app works completely offline.

### How to Test Core Features:

#### 1. Create a Business Card
1. Open app ‚Üí Tap "Add Card"
2. Fill in sample information (Name, Title, Company)
3. Save card

#### 2. Test QR Code Sharing
1. Select a card ‚Üí Tap QR icon
2. QR code displays immediately
3. (Optional) Scan with another device

#### 3. Test Proximity Sharing
‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires two physical devices or simulators with network access**
1. Device A: Tap "Share" ‚Üí Start advertising
2. Device B: Tap "Matching" tab ‚Üí Browse for nearby
3. Device B should see Device A
4. Connect and exchange cards

**Note:** Proximity sharing may not work in simulator networking mode. Testing on physical devices recommended.

#### 4. Test Group Management (ZK Feature)
1. Tap "ID" tab ‚Üí "Group Management"
2. Create a test group (e.g., "Test Group 2025")
3. App generates ZK identity automatically (stored in Keychain)
4. Add members manually or via proximity

#### 5. Test Apple Wallet Export
1. Select a card ‚Üí Tap "Add to Wallet"
2. Pass is generated locally
3. Add to Apple Wallet (or preview)

#### 6. Test Privacy Settings
1. Edit a card ‚Üí Tap privacy icon
2. Configure selective disclosure levels
3. Test sharing with different privacy levels

### What Reviewers Should Verify:

‚úÖ **Privacy:**
