## What is Solid(ar)ity?

Solid(ar)ity is a **fully decentralized, privacy-first** business card sharing app that works entirely offline. No servers. No cloud. No tracking. Just pure peer-to-peer magic.

Exchange business cards with people nearby while maintaining complete control over your personal information through zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure.

### Why it matters

In a world where every interaction gets tracked, stored, and monetized, Solid(ar)ity gives you back control. Your data lives on your device. You decide what to share, when, and with whom. Period.

### Key Features

- **Truly Offline-First**: Works completely without internetâ€”P2P networking via MultipeerConnectivity
- **Zero-Knowledge Identity**: Built on Semaphore protocol for anonymous group membership verification
- **Selective Disclosure**: Share only what's relevantâ€”public, professional, or personal levels
- **Multiple Sharing Methods**: QR codes, AirDrop, WiFi Direct, ShareLinkâ€”whatever works for you
- **Apple Wallet Integration**: Save contacts directly to Apple Wallet with PassKit
- **Group Verification**: Create trusted circles with cryptographic proof of membership
- **No Middleman**: All data stored locally with AES-GCM encryption. No servers, ever.

## How it Works

1. **Create your card** with only the information you want to share
2. **Set privacy levels** for each field (public/professional/personal)
3. **Share nearby** via P2P, QR code, or AirDropâ€”no internet needed
4. **Verify membership** in trusted groups using zero-knowledge proofs
5. **Everything stays local**â€”your data never touches a server

## Built With

- **SwiftUI** - Native iOS interface
- **MultipeerConnectivity** - Apple's P2P networking
- **Semaphore Protocol** - Zero-knowledge proof system via [SemaphoreSwift](https://github.com/zkmopro/SemaphoreSwift)
- **Mopro** - ZK proof generation with native Swift bindings
- **PassKit** - Apple Wallet integration
- **Local Storage** - AES-GCM encrypted file system, no databases

## App Store Launch Checklist

To ship Solid(ar)ity to the App Store, here's what must be done:

### 1. **Core Functionality** âœ“

- [ ] **Crash testing** - Use TestFlight with beta testers
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Profile with Instruments
- [ ] **Network permission handling** - Graceful fallback if denied
- [ ] **Error handling** - No crashes, all edge cases covered
- [ ] **Memory leaks** - Check with Instruments
- [ ] **Accessibility** - VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type
- [ ] **Localization** - At least English, consider Chinese/Japanese
- [ ] **Dark mode** - Full support for light and dark themes

### 5. **Technical Requirements** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
- [ ] **Deployment target**: Set to iOS 16.0 minimum (not 18.5) for broader reach
- [ ] **Code signing**: Valid Apple Developer account
- [ ] **App ID & Provisioning**: Proper configuration
- [ ] **Entitlements**:
  - Associated Domains (if using universal links)
  - Network extensions (for local networking)
  - Keychain access groups
- [ ] **Third-party SDKs**: All dependencies must be secure and maintained
  - âœ“ SemaphoreSwift (active)
  - âœ“ Mopro (active)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Web3Auth (verify license compliance)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Web3.swift (verify license compliance)
- [ ] **Remove backend references**:
  - Delete `APIClient.swift`
  - Delete `APIAuthManager.swift`
  - Delete `APIConfig.swift`
  - Delete `APIModels.swift`
  - Remove from CLAUDE.md documentation

### 6. **User Experience Polish** ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT
- [ ] **Onboarding** - First-time user tutorial (keep it < 3 screens)
- [ ] **Empty states** - Beautiful placeholders for no cards/contacts
- [ ] **Loading states** - Smooth animations during ZK proof generation
- [ ] **Error messages** - User-friendly, actionable (not technical jargon)
- [ ] **Haptic feedback** - Subtle feedback for key interactions
- [ ] **App rating prompt** - Implemented with `StoreKit` after positive interactions

### 7. **Security Audit** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
- [ ] **Keychain security** - Verify Semaphore private keys are properly protected
- [ ] **Encryption audit** - AES-GCM implementation review
- [ ] **ZK proof validation** - Ensure no identity leakage
- [ ] **Code obfuscation** - Consider for cryptographic components
- [ ] **Penetration testing** - Test P2P attack vectors

### 8. **App Store Review Preparation** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

- [ ] **Review notes**: Explain clearly:
  - "App works offline via MultipeerConnectivity"
  - "Test with two devices on same WiFi network"
  - "No login required, data stored locally"
  - "ZK proofs ensure privacy"
- [ ] **Compliance questions**:
  - Encryption: YES (AES-GCM, but exempt under self-classification)

## What Makes This App Store Ready?

**The "One More Thing" Pitch:**

> Most business card apps collect your data, send it to servers, and monetize your connections. Solid(ar)ity is different. It's the **only** business card app that:
> - Works completely offline
> - Uses zero-knowledge cryptography
> - Never touches a server
> - Respects your privacy by design
>
> **This is how networking should work.**

### Minimum Viable Launch (MVP)
Ship with:
- âœ“ Business card creation/editing
- âœ“ QR code sharing (fastest to demo)
- âœ“ Proximity sharing (P2P)
- âœ“ Apple Wallet integration (killer feature)
- âœ“ Basic groups (limit to 3 groups for free tier?)

### Post-Launch Features
- Advanced group management
- ENS integration (most users won't use this v1)
- Web3Auth (adds complexity, remove for v1 if optional)
- Cross-platform (Android, web)

**Bottom Line**: You're 70% there. Focus on polish, privacy compliance, and App Store assets. The tech is solid. Make the experience simple enough that your grandmother could use it, but powerful enough that privacy advocates applaud.
