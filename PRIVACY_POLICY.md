# Privacy Policy for Solid(ar)ity

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-15

## Introduction

Solid(ar)ity is a privacy-first, peer-to-peer business card sharing application that prioritizes your privacy through local-first architecture and advanced zero-knowledge cryptography.

**Our Core Principle:** Your data belongs to you. Everything stays on your device. We operate with zero servers and zero data collection.

---

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Solid(ar)ity is designed to operate **completely offline** with **zero data collection**. We do NOT:

- ❌ Collect personally identifiable information (PII)
- ❌ Track your usage or behavior
- ❌ Store data on remote servers
- ❌ Share data with third parties
- ❌ Use analytics or advertising services
- ❌ Require account creation or login credentials
- ❌ Access your contacts without explicit permission
- ❌ Transmit data over the internet

---

## Information Stored Locally on Your Device

All data generated by Solid(ar)ity is stored **exclusively on your device** using Apple's secure storage mechanisms:

### 1. Business Card Information
- **What:** Name, title, company, email, phone, social media handles, and other fields you choose to add
- **Where:** Encrypted local file storage on your iOS device
- **Encryption:** AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Control:** You can edit or delete this information at any time

### 2. Received Contacts
- **What:** Business cards shared with you by others via proximity sharing, QR codes, or AirDrop
- **Where:** Encrypted local file storage on your device
- **Control:** You can delete received contacts at any time

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Identity
- **What:** Cryptographic keys generated using the Semaphore protocol for zero-knowledge proofs
- **Where:** Stored securely in the iOS Keychain (inaccessible to other apps)
- **Purpose:** Enables privacy-preserving group membership verification without revealing your identity
- **Security:** Private keys never leave your device

### 4. Group Memberships
- **What:** List of Semaphore groups you've created or joined
- **Where:** Encrypted local file storage
- **Privacy:** Group membership can be verified using zero-knowledge proofs without exposing your identity

---

## How Information Is Shared

Solid(ar)ity enables peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of business cards **directly between devices** without any intermediary servers:

### Proximity Sharing (MultipeerConnectivity)
- **Method:** Direct WiFi or Bluetooth connection between nearby iOS devices
- **Data Shared:** Only the business card information you explicitly choose to share, filtered by your selected privacy level (Public, Professional, or Personal)
- **Encryption:** All P2P communications are encrypted by Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework
- **Control:** You choose what to share and when to share it

### QR Code Sharing
- **Method:** Generate a QR code containing your business card information
- **Data Shared:** Only fields you've marked as shareable at your selected privacy level
- **Control:** You decide when to display the QR code and can revoke access by closing the QR code screen

### AirDrop / ShareLink
- **Method:** Standard iOS sharing mechanisms
- **Data Shared:** Business card data formatted as a contact file (vCard)
- **Control:** You initiate all sharing actions

### Apple Wallet (PassKit)
- **Method:** Export business card as an Apple Wallet pass
- **Data Shared:** Contact information stored locally in Apple Wallet
- **Privacy:** Data remains on your device within Apple's secure Wallet app

---

## Selective Disclosure & Privacy Levels

Solid(ar)ity implements **selective disclosure**, allowing you to control exactly what information is shared:

- **Public:** Minimal information (e.g., name and title only)
- **Professional:** Work-related information (e.g., company email, LinkedIn)
- **Personal:** Full information including personal contact details

Before sharing your card, you select the privacy level. Only fields marked for that level will be included in the shared card.

---

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Advanced Privacy Technology)

Solid(ar)ity implements **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** using the **Semaphore protocol** and **Mopro framework** for privacy-preserving group verification:

### What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?
Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that allow you to prove a statement is true (e.g., "I am a member of this group") without revealing any other information about yourself.

### How We Use ZK Technology:

**1. Local Identity Generation**
- A unique cryptographic identity (commitment) is generated **entirely on your device**
- Your identity consists of:
  - **Private key**: Stored securely in iOS Keychain (never leaves your device)
  - **Public commitment**: A cryptographic hash that represents your identity without revealing it
- No personal information is embedded in your ZK identity

**2. Group Membership Verification**
- Join verified groups (e.g., "Conference Attendees 2025", "Company Employees")
- **Prove you're a member** without revealing:
  - Which specific member you are
  - Your personal information
  - Your device identifier
- Example: "I am one of 500 conference attendees" (without disclosing which one)

**3. Selective Disclosure with ZK**
- When sharing your business card, you can generate a ZK proof that:
  - Verifies you belong to a specific group
  - Confirms certain claims (e.g., "I work at Company X")
  - Protects your privacy by not revealing your exact identity within the group

### Technical Implementation:

| Component | Description | Security |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Semaphore Protocol** | Industry-standard ZK group membership protocol | Audited, widely used in privacy tech |
| **Mopro Framework** | Mobile-optimized ZK proof generation | Runs entirely on-device, no network required |
| **Merkle Trees** | Data structure for efficient group membership proofs | Cryptographically secure, tamper-proof |
| **Keychain Storage** | iOS Keychain for private key protection | Hardware-backed encryption (Secure Enclave when available) |

### What Information Is Stored:

**On Your Device:**
- Your ZK identity private key (iOS Keychain)
- Groups you've joined (local encrypted storage)
- Group Merkle roots (public data, no personal info)

**What Is NOT Stored:**
- No centralized database of identities
- No server-side tracking
- No linkage between your ZK identity and your business card

### Privacy Guarantees:
- **Anonymity**: Your identity within a group is protected
- **Unlinkability**: Different proofs cannot be linked to the same person
- **Local Computation**: All ZK proofs are generated on your device
- **No Server Dependency**: ZK verification works peer-to-peer, offline-first

### Use Cases:
1. **Verified Professional Groups**: Prove you work at a company without revealing your employee ID
2. **Event Attendance**: Show you attended a conference without exposing your exact identity
3. **Alumni Networks**: Verify you graduated from a university while maintaining privacy
4. **Privacy-Preserving Networking**: Share credentials without revealing unnecessary personal details

## Permissions Required

Solid(ar)ity requests the following iOS permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | Required? |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| **Local Network Access** | Discover and connect to nearby devices for P2P sharing | Yes (for proximity sharing) |
| **Camera** | Scan QR codes to receive business cards | Optional (only for QR scanning) |
| **Photo Library** | Save QR codes of your business card | Optional (only if you choose to save QR images) |
| **Contacts** | Save received business cards to your device's Contacts app | Optional (only if you choose to export contacts) |

**You can deny any of these permissions.** The app will continue to function with reduced features (e.g., you can still use manual entry without camera access).

---

## Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures:

- **AES-GCM Encryption:** All local data is encrypted using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Keychain Protection:** Cryptographic keys stored in iOS Keychain with device-level security
- **No Cloud Sync:** Data never leaves your device (no iCloud, no backups to external servers)
- **Secure P2P:** MultipeerConnectivity uses TLS-level encryption for device-to-device communication
- **No Server Exposure:** Since we don't use servers, your data cannot be breached or hacked remotely
