# Privacy Policy for Solid(ar)ity

**Last Updated:** 2025.10.02

## Introduction

Solid(ar)ity ("we," "our," or "the app") is a privacy-first business card sharing application. This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to protecting your privacy and details how we handle your information.

**Our Core Principle:** Your data belongs to you. It lives on your device. We never collect, store, or transmit your personal information to any server.

---

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Solid(ar)ity is designed to operate **completely offline** with **zero data collection**. We do NOT:

- ❌ Collect personally identifiable information (PII)
- ❌ Track your usage or behavior
- ❌ Store data on remote servers
- ❌ Share data with third parties
- ❌ Use analytics or advertising services
- ❌ Require account creation or login credentials
- ❌ Access your contacts without explicit permission
- ❌ Transmit data over the internet

---

## Information Stored Locally on Your Device

All data generated by Solid(ar)ity is stored **exclusively on your device** using Apple's secure storage mechanisms:

### 1. Business Card Information
- **What:** Name, title, company, email, phone, social media handles, and other fields you choose to add
- **Where:** Encrypted local file storage on your iOS device
- **Encryption:** AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Control:** You can edit or delete this information at any time

### 2. Received Contacts
- **What:** Business cards shared with you by others via proximity sharing, QR codes, or AirDrop
- **Where:** Encrypted local file storage on your device
- **Control:** You can delete received contacts at any time

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Identity
- **What:** Cryptographic keys generated using the Semaphore protocol for zero-knowledge proofs
- **Where:** Stored securely in the iOS Keychain (inaccessible to other apps)
- **Purpose:** Enables privacy-preserving group membership verification without revealing your identity
- **Security:** Private keys never leave your device

### 4. Group Memberships
- **What:** List of Semaphore groups you've created or joined
- **Where:** Encrypted local file storage
- **Privacy:** Group membership can be verified using zero-knowledge proofs without exposing your identity

---

## How Information Is Shared

Solid(ar)ity enables peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of business cards **directly between devices** without any intermediary servers:

### Proximity Sharing (MultipeerConnectivity)
- **Method:** Direct WiFi or Bluetooth connection between nearby iOS devices
- **Data Shared:** Only the business card information you explicitly choose to share, filtered by your selected privacy level (Public, Professional, or Personal)
- **Encryption:** All P2P communications are encrypted by Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework
- **Control:** You choose what to share and when to share it

### QR Code Sharing
- **Method:** Generate a QR code containing your business card information
- **Data Shared:** Only fields you've marked as shareable at your selected privacy level
- **Control:** You decide when to display the QR code and can revoke access by closing the QR code screen

### AirDrop / ShareLink
- **Method:** Standard iOS sharing mechanisms
- **Data Shared:** Business card data formatted as a contact file (vCard)
- **Control:** You initiate all sharing actions

### Apple Wallet (PassKit)
- **Method:** Export business card as an Apple Wallet pass
- **Data Shared:** Contact information stored locally in Apple Wallet
- **Privacy:** Data remains on your device within Apple's secure Wallet app

---

## Selective Disclosure & Privacy Levels

Solid(ar)ity implements **selective disclosure**, allowing you to control exactly what information is shared:

- **Public:** Minimal information (e.g., name and title only)
- **Professional:** Work-related information (e.g., company email, LinkedIn)
- **Personal:** Full information including personal contact details

Before sharing your card, you select the privacy level. Only fields marked for that level will be included in the shared card.

---

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Solid(ar)ity uses the **Semaphore protocol** to enable privacy-preserving group verification:

- **Identity Generation:** A cryptographic identity is generated locally on your device
- **Group Membership:** You can prove you belong to a group (e.g., "Attendees of Conference X") without revealing which specific member you are
- **No Data Exposure:** Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification of claims without exposing your identity or personal information
- **Local Computation:** All proof generation happens on your device using the Mopro framework

Technical Details:
- Private keys are stored securely in the iOS Keychain
- Proofs are generated on-device and never transmitted to external servers
- Group Merkle roots may be stored on decentralized systems (e.g., IPFS) for verification, but these contain no personal information

---

## Permissions Required

Solid(ar)ity requests the following iOS permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | Required? |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| **Local Network Access** | Discover and connect to nearby devices for P2P sharing | Yes (for proximity sharing) |
| **Camera** | Scan QR codes to receive business cards | Optional (only for QR scanning) |
| **Photo Library** | Save QR codes of your business card | Optional (only if you choose to save QR images) |
| **Contacts** | Save received business cards to your device's Contacts app | Optional (only if you choose to export contacts) |

**You can deny any of these permissions.** The app will continue to function with reduced features (e.g., you can still use manual entry without camera access).

---

## Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures:

- **AES-GCM Encryption:** All local data is encrypted using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Keychain Protection:** Cryptographic keys stored in iOS Keychain with device-level security
- **No Cloud Sync:** Data never leaves your device (no iCloud, no backups to external servers)
- **Secure P2P:** MultipeerConnectivity uses TLS-level encryption for device-to-device communication
- **No Server Exposure:** Since we don't use servers, your data cannot be breached or hacked remotely

---

## Third-Party Services

Solid(ar)ity **does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services**.

The app uses the following open-source libraries for core functionality:
- **SemaphoreSwift** (https://github.com/zkmopro/SemaphoreSwift) - Zero-knowledge proof implementation
- **Mopro** (https://zkmopro.org/) - Mobile proof generation framework

These libraries run **entirely on your device** and do not transmit data to external servers.

---

## Children's Privacy

Solid(ar)ity is **not directed at children under 13**. We do not knowingly collect information from children. Since the app operates entirely locally and collects no data, there is no risk of inadvertently collecting children's information.

---

## International Users

Solid(ar)ity is designed for global use. Since all data is stored locally on your device and no information is transmitted to servers, **no data crosses international borders**. You maintain full control of your data regardless of your location.

---

## Your Rights

As a Solid(ar)ity user, you have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** All your data is accessible within the app at any time
- **Correction:** Edit your business card or contact information anytime
- **Deletion:** Delete any or all data within the app settings
- **Export:** Export your data as backups or vCard files
- **Portability:** Your data is stored in standard formats and can be exported

Since we don't collect data on servers, there's no need to request data deletion or access from us—you have direct control through the app.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

We will notify users of significant changes through:
- In-app notifications
- Updates to this document on our website

## Transparency Commitment

Unlike most apps, Solid(ar)ity is **open source**. You can review our code to verify our privacy claims:

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/kidneyweakx/solidarity

We believe in privacy by design, not just by policy. Our architecture makes it **impossible** for us to collect your data—there are no servers to send it to.

---

**Bottom Line:**
Your data stays on your device. Period.
